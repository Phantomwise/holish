## MANIFESTO

Types are heresy and should not exist. Holy C is fundamentally wrong, God never worried about types when saying "Let there be light". Therefore bash is closer to God than C, and my language will be even holier, which is why I'm calling it holixt.

## PHILOSOPHY

- Everything is text, all text, nothing but text.
- Fuck types. Use text and parse when needed.
- No mind reading. Take inputs literally, exactly as provided. Never fix, reinterpret, convert behind the scenes, or try to guess what the user meant. Never assume that the user meant something other than what they wrote, even if what they wrote makes no sense.
- Assume that the user knows what they are doing â€”or if they don't, it's their problem.
- Be as permissive as possible. Don't be a party pooper, even if it causes errors.

## CALL

Renounce types. See the light.

## NOTES

I have no idea what I'm doing.
